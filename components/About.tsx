      Hi, I’m Kwaku Amo-Korankye, a final-year AI major at Academic City University College, 
      and I’m passionate about using AI to make a real difference in people’s lives. Right now, 
      I’m working on an AI-based diagnostics platform that helps analyze medical imaging with 
      deep learning to make healthcare decisions faster and more accurate. I’m also building a 
      daily news email bulletin that curates updates tailored to each user—projects that bring AI 
      into everyday life in meaningful ways.

      I care deeply about performance and UI/UX of applied AI systems. I am also an avid enjoyer 
      of building something people want. I’m eager to explore the latest AI research, deepen my 
      expertise, and collaborate with fellow enthusiasts and professionals on groundbreaking projects. 
      At the same time, I’m hands-on with customizing deep learning architectures and turning ideas 
      into practical, user-friendly tools. My ultimate goal is to push boundaries and develop 
      AI-driven solutions that truly make a difference in people’s lives.
