      Hi, I’m Kwaku Amo-Korankye, a final-year AI major at <a href="https://acity.edu.gh/study/BSc-Artificial-Intelligence.php" className="font-bold underline" target="_blank">Academic City University</a>, 
      and I’m passionate about using AI to make a real difference in people’s lives. Right now, 
      I’m working on <a href="#projects" className="font-bold underline">Diagnostics AI: an AI-based diagnostics platform that helps analyze medical imaging</a> with 
      deep learning to make healthcare decisions faster and more accurate.

      I care deeply about performance and UI/UX of applied AI systems. I am also an avid enjoyer of building something people want to us.
      I am currently learning about <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agents" className="font-bold underline">AI Agents</a> and how they can automate workflows and admin tasks.
