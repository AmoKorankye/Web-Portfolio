      Hello, my name is Kwaku Amo-Korankye. I recently graduated from <a href="https://acity.edu.gh/study/BSc-Artificial-Intelligence.php" className="font-bold underline" target="_blank">Academic City University</a> with a first class in BSc Artificial Intelligence, 
      and I’m passionate about using AI to make a real difference in people’s lives. Currently, I’m working on <a href="#projects" className="font-bold underline">[redacted]</a>, a financial agent that acts as a team member, 
        that means it understands your businesses context and lives in your financials
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base">
      I care deeply about performance and UI/UX of applied AI systems. I am also an avid enjoyer of building something people want to use. I’m open to collaborating on any and everything, feel free to reach out!
